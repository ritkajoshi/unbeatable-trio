Description of game:
This is a two player game in which either one human and AI can play the tic tac toe or two human beings can play it.
how to play the game :

the user can have four options as follows:

1)HUMAN VS AI - under this option the user can play with the computer or AI.
2)HUMAN VS HUMAN 3X3 - under this option the user can play with other human being in the 3X3 board of tictactoe.
3)HUMAN VS HUMAN 4X4 - under this option the user can play with other human being in the 4X4 board of tictactoe.
4)HUMAN VS HUMAN 6X6 - under this option the user can play with other human being in the 6X6 board of tictactoe.

The algorithms used in the game are:

In the HUMAN VS AI part of the game , we have used the alpha beta pruning so that the minimax algorithm can be made more efficient.
The algorithm evaluates the moves that lead to a terminal state based on the player's turn. It will choose the move with maximum score when it is the AI’s turn and choose the move with the minimum score when it is the human player’s turn. Using this strategy, minimax avoids losing to the human player.

In the other components of the game which are two human player game , no algorithms were required as they are human specific games.
